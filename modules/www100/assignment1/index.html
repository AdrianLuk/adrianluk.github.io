			With offices at 555 Coding Court, in Toronto's downtown core,
			we have established ourselves as Canada's first and foremost web development and marketing company.

			<p>Our blog was developed as a result of founder Dr. Doctype’s belief that he could make people more aware of beautifully crafted code.
			In August 2014, he left his position as Senior Developer at the Coding Network and dedicated himself to turning his vision into reality.</p>

What works is good, integrated design that fills a need—carefully thought out, well executed, and tested.</i><br> - Dr. Doctype (Webmaster Solutions founder)</blockquote>
