	<h2>Warm Colors</h2>
		<article class="red">
		<h3>Red</h3>
			<div id="redbox"></div>
				<p>Red is typically associated with power and importance. It is by far the most stimulating color, typically being used for warnings and prompts for action due to it increasing breathing and pulse. It also symbolizes passion and romance which is why it is used in fashion brands and also in dating websites.</p>
		</article>
		<article class="orange">
			<h3>Orange</h3>
			<div id="orangebox"></div>
				<p>Orange is a "fun" color that can evoke a sense of urgency, energy, or impulse. It is typically used sparingly, usually only used to bring attention to something. For example, Amazon uses orange to bring attention to their "limited time offer" banner. However, orange is sometimes interpreted as "cheap." Thus if the product is cheap or wants to be seen as cheap, then orange is a good choice.</p>
		</article>
		<article class="yellow">
			<h3>Yellow</h3>
			<div id="yellowbox"></div>
				<p>Yellow is a complicated color. Depending on the shade used, yellow can be very energetic, or also give off a sense of antiquity. Bright yellow is most energetic, but does not imply as much severity as red. Middle or neutral shades of yellow give off a feeling of comfort while still being energetic. Dark shades can give the impression of antiquity, wisdom, and curiosity.</p>

<section class="cool">
<div id="coolcolors">
	<h2>Cool Colors</h2>
		<article class="blue">
			<h3>Blue</h3>
			<div id="bluebox"></div>
				<p>Blue is one of the most common colors. Blue gives off a feeling of trustworthiness, security, loyalty, peace, and order. Facebook and many banks use the color blue intentionally to give their customers the subconscious feeling that they are able to be trusted with sensitive information. There is a common consensus that blue should not be used for anything related to food as it is believed to suppress appetites.</p>
		</article>
		<article class="green">
			<h3>Green</h3>
			<div id="greenbox"></div>
				<p>Green is used generally for environmental and outdoor products. Naturally, it is connected to nature, eco-friendliness, and the environment. If your product has anything to do with the outdoors or the environment, you can never go wrong with the color green. Lighter shades of green can also be associated with innovation and creativity.</p>
		</article>
		<article class="purple">
			<h3>Purple</h3>
			<div id="purplebox"></div>
				<p>Historically, purple was associated with royalty. So it is no surprise that purple is still connected to luxury, lavishness and wealth. It is most commonly used for fashion and luxury goods. It also exudes elegance and femininity and spans a large female demographic. Purple is also a color with no negative associations.</p>

<div id="neutralcolors">
	<h2>Neutral Colors</h2>
		<article class="black">
			<h3>Black</h3>
			<div id="blackbox"></div>
				<p>Black is a color which promotes classiness, sophistication, and conventional. It suggests excellence and formality as well as luxury and exclusivity. Black is closely associated with timelessness and is used a lot in high-end products.</p>
		</article>
		<article class="grey">
			<h3>Grey</h3>
			<div id="greybox"></div>
				<p>Grey is a color which promotes neutrality and formality. Depending on the shade of grey used, emotions associated can range from sad and somber, to modern and contemporary.

				</article>
		<article class="white">
			<h3>White</h3>
			<div id="whitebox"></div>
				<p>White is an often overlooked color, probably because it is seen as a lack of color. It is most associated with purity and innocence as well as simplicity and spaciousness. Many well designed websites make very good use of white space to accent other colors, give a sense of freedom, and even give off a modern vibe.</p>
