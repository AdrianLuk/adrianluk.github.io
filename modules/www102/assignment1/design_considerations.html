		<h3>Layout</h3>
	<article id="audiencepoints">
		<h4>Things considered with target audience</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Kumon uses lighter shades of colors such as blue and yellow because even the brand and logo convey youth and their programs are targeted towards kids because they offer after school programs.</li>
			<li>Oxford is more geared towards general school ages including teens and also their parents so they use navy blue and darker shades of colors.</li>
			<li>The big two competitors that I found, Kumon and Oxford are both very responsive, presumably because they are bigger and have more money to spend on making their websites more responsive. The smaller schools likely simply made a functioning page but did not consider responsiveness or accessibility as much as it would require more resources to implement.</li>
		</ul>
	</article>
	<article id="layoutpoints">
		<h4>Things considered layout-wise</h4>
			<ul>
			  <li>One column scheme generally</li>
			  <li>width is usually all the way across the screen</li>
			  <li>lots of sub pages and links to other pages in site</li>
			  <li>navigation bar and links on top of page horizontally</li>
			  <li>button placement is usually above the middle level of the screen such as the nav bar.</li>
			  <li>Kumon and Oxford, the two biggest ones, have very responsive websites</li>
			  <li>Mulitple instances even on the same page where location and contact information can be found and buttons linking to maps and nearby locations.</li>
			  <li>All have buttons and navigations for the offered programs.</li>
			  <li>Lots of pictures of children and school aged kids in a school or educational setting.</li>
			  <li>Also lots of pictures depicting school related things such as books and stationery.</li>
			  <li>They mainly used a responsive fluid width for their website to accomodate different screen sizes</li>
			</ul>
    </article>
	<article id="fontpoints">
		<h4>Things considered for fonts</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Almost if not all sans-serif fonts. </li>
				<li>Blocky text especially for headings</li>
				<li>Heading sizes are much bigger thus are emphasized heavily</li>
				<li>Most important and header texts are fully capitalized to draw attention to it.</li>
				<li>Some buttons use different or modified fonts for emphasis.</li>
				<li>The big 2 always have contact and programs offered links readily available, no matter where you are on the page. They make it very easy to navigate to signup pages or information pages such as their call to action buttons.</li>
			</ul>
		
	</article>
	<article id="colorpoints">
       <h4>Things considered with color choices</h4>
        <ul>
			<li>Button color is themed according to website color palette and color themes of the section</li>
			<li>Lots of white text</li>
			<li>Red is used extremely sparingly. Only used to for calls to action such as finding our location or contact/calling information.</li>
			<li>When red is used, it is almost always used with white. When not used with white, it was used with blue as with Oxford's phone number in the footer. It would likely cause an accessibility issue.</li>
			<li>Backgrounds and blocks and buttons are color themed and match the themes of the website and the brand.</li>
			<li>Some of the white text is hard to read on top of some of the background images. The easily readable ones place the text in parts where the background color is more consistent.</li>
			<li>Yellow is very prominent and popular because according to color psychology, yellow conveys youth and energy.</li>
			<li>Kumon uses lighter hues geared towards a less mature audience and the lighter colors convey a more youthful target</li>
			<li>Oxford uses a darker shade of blue and yellow, such as navy blue because their brand is more geared towards general ages and parents rather than just children.</li>
		</ul>
	</article>
	<article id="navigationpoints">
		<h4>Things considered with navigation</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Menu and navigation bar are usually fixed positioned across the top of the page and follows as you scroll down.</li>
			<li>There are location and contact links/buttons embedded throughout the homepage so that even in a long page, the most important links and buttons are present in the middle.</li>
		</ul>
