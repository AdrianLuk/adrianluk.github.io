    'For community based CMS, finding direct support would be difficult and forums or existing documentation would have to be relied upon.',
    'Content is dynamic, and is therefore slow. CMS relies on database calls for HTML content so websites with lots of traffic will load slower due to the amount of simultaneous database calls.',
    'Code bloat, or unnecessary extra code, could potentially slow down website performance and negatively affect SEO and cross-browser compatibility.',

    'Powerful admin interface but also user-friendly and has best interface for managing large amounts of articles. E-Commerce support and many extensions available to facilitate management of products and content all in one place. Strong developer community constantly creating free open source plugins and extensions. Five categories of extensions: plugins, components, modules, templates and languages. Each provide different functionality and capability.',
